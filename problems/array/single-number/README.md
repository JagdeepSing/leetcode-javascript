# 136. Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

## Example 1:

```js
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

## Example 2:

```js
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```
