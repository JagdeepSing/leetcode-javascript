# 238. Product of Array Except Self
## Medium

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers where `n > 1`, return an array output 
such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of 
nums except `nums[i]`.

## Example:
```js
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).
